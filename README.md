# Weather-app-using-Django

The App was created just to try out my hands on API, this was the first time I ever worked with an api. 
This project takes user's search text, runs a query regarding the search text in api, the result is given in a json file.
Parsing the Json-file with python gives us our desired results.
The result are then shown to the user in index.html.
